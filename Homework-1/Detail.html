    <h1>You can find information about the CSS here </h1>
    <p class="Cssinformation">CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a
        document written in a markup language, most commonly HTML. It is a core technology of the World Wide Web,
        alongside HTML and JavaScript. </p>

    <p class="ulpart">Essentially, CSS dictates how HTML elements should be displayed on various media, such as screens, paper, or in
        speech. This includes aspects like:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Styling: Defining colors, fonts, text sizes, backgrounds, and other visual properties.
        </li>
        <li>Layout: Controlling the positioning of elements, creating multi-column layouts, and ensuring responsiveness across different device sizes.</li>
        <li>Animations and Transitions: Adding dynamic visual effects to enhance user interaction.</li>
    </ul>
